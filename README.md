# Virtual Keyboard Project in Python

## Overview

This Virtual Keyboard project in Python is a simple yet functional implementation of a virtual keyboard using the Tkinter library. The virtual keyboard provides an on-screen interface that allows users to input text and control their computer without the need for a physical keyboard. It can be particularly useful in scenarios where a physical keyboard is not available or convenient.

## Features

1. **User-friendly Interface:** The virtual keyboard offers a clean and intuitive graphical user interface.

2. **Text Input:** Users can input text by clicking on the virtual keys.

3. **Special Characters:** The keyboard includes special characters, numbers, and symbols for comprehensive text input.

4. **Basic Control Keys:** Essential control keys such as Enter, Backspace, and Shift are included for convenient text editing.

## Requirements
